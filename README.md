# Data Analysis: Translation Services Sales (2020–2025)

This repository contains my first public data analysis project using Microsoft Excel. The analysis focuses on the sales of translation services and their usage by different client segments:

- Sole proprietors (JDG)
- Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
- Corporations

Time range of the data: **2020–2025**

## 📊 Purpose of the Analysis

The goal was to understand trends in translation service sales depending on client type, seasonality, and broader economic or social factors (e.g., the pandemic, inflation, digitization).

## 🛠️ Repository Contents

- `translation_services_sales_analysis_2020_2025.xlsx` – main Excel file containing:
  - raw data
  - processed summaries
  - charts
  - conclusions

- `README.md` – this file, describing the project

## 📌 Methodology

- Data was collected based on actual translation service orders.
- Clients were categorized by business type.
- Basic Excel tools were used (pivot tables, conditional formatting, charts).
- Insights were drawn from yearly and quarterly trends.

## 🔍 Key Observations

- The highest growth in orders came from SMEs during 2022–2023.
- Corporations showed a stable, moderate level of demand.
- Sole proprietors tended to use translation services seasonally (e.g., before grant deadlines).

## 💡 Conclusions and Next Steps

This analysis offers preliminary insights useful for planning future translation service offerings. In the future, I plan to:

- Extend the analysis to include financial data (revenue, average order value)
- Migrate data to Python/Pandas for automation
- Compare trends with broader market data
