Translation Services Data Analysis (2024â€“2025)

This is my first mature data analysis project carried out in Microsoft Excel, without using pivot tables. The analysis covers the period from 2024 to 2025 and focuses on the translation industry.

The dataset was created for hypothetical business scenarios and includes two main areas:

Percentage share of clients by voivodeship (Polish regions) in total service sales

Percentage share of each translation service in overall revenue

The goal of this analysis was to better understand customer distribution across regions and to evaluate which services contribute most to the business. I used basic Excel functions, charts, and conditional formatting to present the data clearly and insightfully.

This project represents an important step in my development as a data analyst and reflects my growing ability to extract meaningful insights from structured data.
